# TidyTask üìù‚ú®

hey! so this is my task management app that i built for my portfolio (and also because i desperately needed something to help me stay organized lol)

## what is this?

basically it's a student-focused task manager with a bunch of features that actually help me focus. i have ADHD so i made sure everything was colorful and animated because that's what works for my brain

## why i built this

honestly? i was tired of using those boring todo apps that all look the same. plus they never really "got" how student brains work, especially neurodivergent ones. so i decided to make my own!

took me way longer than expected (classic me procrastinating and then hyperfocusing at 2am) but i'm pretty happy with how it turned out üòä

## features

- **colorful design** - bright pastels that don't hurt your eyes
- **smooth animations** - because they're satisfying and help me focus
- **task management** - duh, it's in the name lol
- **progress tracking** - with charts and stuff
- **gamification** - points and levels because why not make studying fun?
- **mobile responsive** - works on phone too (tested on my iphone)

## tech stuff

built with:
- react (took me forever to learn but worth it)
- vite (SO much faster than create-react-app)
- tailwind css (never going back to regular css)
- framer motion (the animations library that made me fall in love with animations)
- a bunch of other stuff i found on npm

## how to run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

then open http://localhost:5173

if it doesn't work... idk try googling the error message? that's what i always do üòÖ

## things i learned

- motion (framer motion) is amazing but the docs can be confusing
- z-index will drive you insane
- always test on mobile BEFORE spending 3 hours perfecting desktop layout
- console.log is your best friend
- coffee is also your best friend

## known issues

- ~~navbar animation was being weird~~ FIXED (finally!)
- ~~login button gradient wouldn't slide~~ FIXED (took forever but works now)
- dark mode isn't implemented yet (maybe later?)
- probably some bugs i haven't found yet

## future plans

- [ ] add calendar view
- [ ] pomodoro timer integration
- [ ] study music player maybe?
- [ ] actually deploy this somewhere
- [ ] fix whatever breaks next lol

## credits

made by me! a stressed student who learned web dev from youtube tutorials and stack overflow

inspired by:
- notion (for the clean design)
- habitica (for the gamification idea)
- my chaotic brain (for knowing what i needed)

## license

MIT or whatever - honestly just don't copy it word for word for your portfolio, that's not cool

---

if you're reading this and you also have ADHD or any neurodivergent stuff going on, i hope this app helps you as much as it helped me! we deserve tools that work WITH our brains, not against them üíú

ps: yes i know there's probably better ways to do some of this code but it works and i'm not touching it unless it breaks üòÇ
